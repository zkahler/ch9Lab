Responsive web design provides an optimum viewing experience for

2 
00:04.100 --> 00:08.000 
desktop tablet and mobile devices.

3 
00:08.500 --> 00:12.000 
Begin by creating a wire frame for each viewport.

4 
00:12.500 --> 00:16.000 
Larger viewports allow for multiple columns of content.

5 
00:19.000 --> 00:22.500 
Use a single column layout for mobile viewports. 

6 
00:23.000 --> 00:25.000 
When the wireframes are complete

7 
00:25.100 --> 00:28.000 
you can begin the web page development.
